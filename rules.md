Rules:

2 - 6 players

Each player starts with 4 cards arranged in a 2x2 formation

Each player can see their bottom two cards momentarily before the game begins

When a turn begins, the active player must either pick up a card from the deck or from the top of the discard pile

They can make two decisions:

1.  Replace a card in their "hand" facedown and discard the replaced card face up
2.  Choose not to replace and discard the picked up card face up

The card that has been discarded is the "played" card

Depending on what the card is, it may have a power that can be used, and has a count value associated with it

 - A through 6: No power; value is 1 - 6 respectively
 - 7 or 8: Choose to momentarily view any card in your "hand"; value is 7, 8 respectively
 - 9 or 10: Choose to momentarily view any card in any other player's "hand"; value is 9, 10 respectively
 - J or Q: Choose to swap any card in your "hand" with any card in another player's "hand" without looking at either one; value is 11, 12 respectively
 - Black K (Spades or Clubs): Choose to swap any card in your "hand" with any card in another player's "hand" without looking at both momentarily; value is 13
 - Red K (Hearts or Diamonds): No power; value is 0
 - Joker: No power; value is -1

After a card is played, there will be a 5 second waiting period for any player to attempt a "snap"

A failed snap will incur the consequences and reset the waiting period

A "snap" is picking a card from any player's "hand" that you believe matches the currently played card and placing it on the discard pile

Two successful snaps may occur:

1. You snap from your own "hand"; you now have one less card in your "hand"
2. You snap from another players "hand"; you choose a card from your own "hand" to replace the card that you snapped from the other player(also one less card for you now)

Two unsuccessful snaps may occur:

1. You fail a snap from your own "hand"; you must return the card to it's original position and draw an extra card to your "hand"
2. You fail a snap from another players "hand"; you must return the card to it's original position in the player's "hand" and draw an extra card to your "hand"

Only one player may successfully snap in a turn (quickest wins the snap)

Objective of the game is to try to reduce the total count of your 4 cards as much as possible

Game ends when someone calls "Cabo" at the beginning of their turn after at least 3 rounds have been completed

If the player who calls Cabo doesn't actually have the lowest count, their count is instead noted as 10

All other players note their count as per their "hand" count at the end of the game

Multiple games are played for a total count (1, 3, 6, 9+)
